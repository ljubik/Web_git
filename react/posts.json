    "content":{"rendered":"<p>If you are reading this article, then most probably you are planning to cooperate with a team of Software Engineers or planning to order the creation of the unique software. Everyone who has already worked with programmers would say that they are kind of different race of people. They are capable to make sense from the utter gibberish. Doesn\u2019t matters whether you need a unique program, create a fancy animation or anything else &#8211; IT engineers are able to make all your ideas into reality.<br \/>\nSo, what do need for successful cooperation with coders? Important is to understand what you should never ask them. It is even more important than knowing what to ask. Let\u2019s review few the most terrifying question which makes developers crazy.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>How exactly that part of the code works?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2483\" title=\"How exactly that part of the code works\" src=\"https:\/\/inoxoft.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/second.jpg\" alt=\"Image \u2014 How exactly that part of the code works\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you are not a programmer, then there are no chances for you to understand the code. This is the same as asking a doctor to explain to you in details the problem and diagnosis. The reason is that programming is a complex of codes, actions and an infinite number of conditions to be satisfied, which lead to the desired result. Programming includes a great amount of logic and complex knowledge which cannot be gained in a couple of hours or even days. And one more reason is that programmers themselves are not always sure how exactly the code runs, but in the result, everything works well.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>In the beginning, make it prettier and bouncing.<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Just for your information bouncing and making animation is the easiest part of the work, so normally programmers are doing it at the end of the job. The reasons are obvious, the easiest work is done in the end, and if the animation is done on the early stage of the development then there is no guarantee that in the end website is going to work well.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>But how can you be a girl?!<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2481\" title=\"The programmer is a girl\" src=\"https:\/\/inoxoft.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/first.jpg\" alt=\"Image \u2014 The programmer is a girl\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Even in the 21st century, there are people who are shocked by the fact that the programmer is a girl. Yes, there is a stereotype that coders are mostly men 20-30 years old, who cannot code without slippers and preferable eats in the working place, as there is a need to work 24\/7. Just forget about it! It is a modern era, where men and women are working under the same conditions. Visit Inoxoft office, and you will see how many nice women are working, coding and having a great success in this field. Do you know, who is the founder of programming and by whom the first computer program was written? By Ada Lovelace, and she was a woman, so hide your stereotypes!<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>By the way, my PC is not working, can you fix it?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Can pilot fix crashed plane? I don\u2019t think so. Then how can programmer fix a computer, an IT engineer is creating the software, makes it work well from inside. Just try to imagine how does it feels then listen to something like: \u201cLook, my keyboard is not working, can you fix it?\u201d or \u201cCan you connect the printer to the computer?\u201d, this is the same as asking the doctor to check the temperature or to do the injection. If you have any issues with the PC &#8211; ask the repairman to come over and fix it.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>I don\u2019t like the background, can you change it? *Changes background* Ohh.. actually previous one was better, change it back!<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2482\" title=\"Change background on my computer\" src=\"https:\/\/inoxoft.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/fourth.jpg\" alt=\"Image \u2014 Change background on my computer\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is a real headache for a programmer. As, the person who is handling the code, has to make thousands of actions to adapt it to the new requirement. It does not work like changing a background on the PC desktop. So, if you request any kind of changes mind it several times and make sure that this is really something you need. If you have any doubts regarding new requirements &#8211; take your time and mind it again.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>You know, I\u2019ve been reading a book about programming on my way to the office, I think you should do it in another way.<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you know a little bit of coding &#8211; then congratulations, keep your knowledge, improve it, at least to junior level, and code yourself. I suppose you would never suggest doctor what to do if you know a little bit of biology. You can add your recommendations only in case if you have sufficient level of knowledge and coding experience.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>C\u2019mon, it&#8217;s Sunday, why can\u2019t you leave your computer?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>This is probably weird for most people, but programmers (not all of them) really enjoy doing small coding sessions on Sunday. This a kind of joy with favorite music on, a cup of nice coffee and other stuff which they really like. So, why not to enjoy little things that make you happy.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>You drink too much coffee, can\u2019t you live without it?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2484\" title=\"Programmers' addiction to the caffeine\" src=\"https:\/\/inoxoft.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/third.jpg\" alt=\"Image \u2014 Programmers' addiction to the caffeine\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Why not? Coffee stimulates the brain activity and is quite tasty. Some people say that programming and coffee-addiction are going hand in hand, a programmer without coffee is the same as HTML without CSS. Of course, not all coders are addicted to caffeine. Generally, there is a desire to go to the kitchen, fresh up your mind, talk to colleagues regarding bugs and issues with the new project. Also, if you work a lot sitting at the desk under air conditioning &#8211; you need to keep water balance on the required level. Moreover, the work of the software engineer sometimes requires work at night and in this case you need coffee to stay up.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>..And Bonus<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Never tell the programmer to put off the headphones, even do not try to suggest that without music it will be easier to concentrate. It will not, some codders prefer to watch movies during coding, while others listen to music, it really helps them to concentrate and do coding easier.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>Summing up<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Each profession has its stereotypes and weird thoughts. In order to improve communication experience with Software Engineers mind the specific sides of their work, and take care of advises we described above.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"If you are reading this article, then most probably you are planning to cooperate with a team of Software Engineers or planning to order the creation of the unique software.

The work of IT engineers seems to be an easy one, coders have opportunities to work remotely, from all around the world, have a possibility to mix working and holidays and earning a really good money for that. Is this job really so perfect, and there are no disadvantages? I suppose a lot of programmers would argue and claim that despite all the advantages there are things which can be called as coders worth nightmare. Let&#8217;s review what can be so bad in the work of IT engineers. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2467\" title=\"Coder's nightmare \u2014 Bugs in the code\" src=\"https:\/\/inoxoft.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/01-2.jpg\" alt=\"Image \u2014 Coder's nightmare \u2014 Bugs in the code\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>Bugs appearing at the wrong time<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, there is never a good time for bugs, especially when those occur after weeks or even months of hard working process, which includes development and testing. So, at the moment when the final version is presented to the team and clients, bugs appear, or even worse, when it appears after final release to the customer, and the company receives a bunch of negative feedback. Even if it is a small one, users will harass you as if you\u2019ve killed an infant. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>Fixing another programmer\u2019s bugs<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will not have to do that only if you are lucky, very lucky. But in many cases, you will be asked to fix someone else\u2019s bugs. Mostly it occurs if you are new in the company or after someone suddenly quits the project, without finishing it properly and making a handover. Normally it is not easy to understand the code written by someone else, and it is even harder if there is not proper documentation or comments to the code. So, you can imagine how painful is to read, check and fix a code which you cannot understand completely.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>Fixed one bug \u2013 created more bugs<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2468\" title=\"Coder's nightmare \u2014 infinite amount of bugs\" src=\"https:\/\/inoxoft.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/02-2.jpg\" alt=\"Image \u2014 Coder's nightmare \u2014 infinite amount of bugs\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One more terrible moment in the programming process is when you fix one bug and that created more bugs. I think this feeling is common for everyone, not only for coders when you find a solution for one issue but a lot of different problems happen to be. Even in the programming, the new bugs are not really new, just old and hidden ones, so anyway it should have been fixed for successful release and work of the application. Nevertheless, that is a frustrating moment. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>Bug existing in the library you depend on<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is something even worth than the situations described above, when you are tired from fixing bugs, and the program does not work well enough still. In this situation, you may feel useless and hopeless, and not able to improve the scenario. There still are a few ways to influence it:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Request the developer of the library to fix the bug, of course, this is going to take some time. However, you are not the only one the only one facing that issue, so the help will be useful for other developers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if you are sure about your competence &#8211; try to fix it yourself. This action is not the easiest one to do, but it may improve your level as IT engineer or cause a lot of problems for everyone else working with the same library. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last but not least solution to the problem is to look for another library. Maybe there is another one to use, or you may build your own code. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>Unknown source of the bug<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One more big issue, which is hated by developers &#8211; when the source of the bug is unknown. Actually, this problem happens to everyone, in this situation almost nothing can help, developers should work day and night to find the bug, Google search does not help you to find an issue, you feel that answer is outside your grasp. The best way out of that issue is to make the step backward, refresh the mind, make a break and the solution will be found.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>Backup absence when data gets lost<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is probably the worst situation which could ever happen with a developer. We do not live in the perfect world, and even with the great development of technologies &#8211; no one is protected from the data lost. It may happen with the sudden loss of electricity, internet or is coffee suddenly split all over the computer. The only advice is &#8211; always make a backup of each step of the work and you will not have to redo the same job for several times.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>Infinite problem with semicolons<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the software, programming semicolons play a very important role, and if one is missing it can lead to a big number of errors. Even one missing semicolon can throw up errors all around the product. There can be the even worse scenario when because of the missing semicolon the app just stops working. The situation is not from the list of the best ones, it can be one of the worse nightmares, as to fix the bug you should look all around the code to add a missing semicolon. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>Issues with the Internet<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2469\" title=\"Coder's nightmare \u2014 no internet connection\" src=\"https:\/\/inoxoft.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/03-2.jpg\" alt=\"Image \u2014 Coder's nightmare \u2014 no internet connection\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Internet is important not only for coders but also for every person. Nowadays, we cannot imagine messaging, watching movies, reading books and even preparing for exams without the Internet and the main helper &#8211; Google. For IT engineers lack the internet means zero chances to work. While Google has even higher importance for developers, as this is a universal source of information.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><b>Summing up<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The life of IT engineers is not as brightly and without problems as it seems to be. There are a lot of issues which can be faced while coding, we have described the only a couple of them. Despite all the issues, the profession of the software developer is full of interesting projects and colorful events.

We have already <a href=\"https:\/\/inoxoft.com\/top-things-to-ask-your-contractor\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">described questions that help you looking for a vendor<\/a>, differences between <a href=\"https:\/\/inoxoft.com\/outsourcing-vs-outstaffing-whats-so-good-about-hiring-a-team-for-your-project\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">outsourcing and outstaffing<\/a>, and<a href=\"https:\/\/inoxoft.com\/searching-for-the-one\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> how to find your contractor<\/a>. Now it is time to discuss the next question, which should be asked first, to hire IT team or to outsource business to the external provider?<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><strong>Count it Out<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>First of all, try to count the cost difference between permanently hired staff, including the cost of onboarding, hourly rate, etc., and outsourcing. It that moment, a lot of companies turn out to help the external vendors. Choosing an experienced team, who worked with similar projects to yours, will definitely be an advantage. Comparing to hiring a new in-house team, which has no experience working together and should adjust to the working style, project, and company.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\">Use the possibility to find the best one, from any part of the world<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>One more feature of outsourcing is the possibility to check out the market, compare the quality of services and prices in any country. Of course, there may be some communication barriers, but we live in the globalized world with unlimited access to the internet, where almost everyone speaks English, those facts decrease problems. There are more advantages of outsourcing:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A vendor will decide who is the best for your project, together with a Quality Assurance team, Business Analysts and Good level of Project management<\/li>\n<li>You will not need a full team of software developers, after the end of the project, so there is much more sense to outsource the project<\/li>\n<li>As well as, there is no need to invest in the equipment, which similarly will not be needed at the end of the project<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Together with mentioned above, there are some advantages of in-house software development:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The team will be trained according to company policies. It may be specifically helpful for companies that work with sensitive data<\/li>\n<li>The IT team will be available for you at any time in the same office. This can be especially valuable in case of emergency, such as a security breach<\/li>\n<li>You will be sure that design of the desired software is uniquely developed for the needs of the business<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\">What about 2-in-1?<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Ultimately, most companies are looking for a mixture of both in-house and outsourcing development. An in-house IT team is essential and may be focused on customer support, security or online marketing. In the same time, roles of graphic designers, problem troubleshooters, software developers can be outsourced.<\/p>\n<p>Building the right in-house IT team requires patience, diligence and a clear understanding of the skills a company will require in the long term. While outsourcing may seem a more immediate, cost-effective solution. What is clear is that as IT becomes more central to the running of any successful business, more companies will realize that they need to have experts in various IT fields working for them full-time.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color: #00ccff;\">Summing Up<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The choice between an in-house team and software development outsourcing provider comes down to the cost and the quality issues. If setting up an in-house team proves too costly, you should try to find a software outsourcing company. Finally, the answer to the questions: \u201cto hire or not to hire?\u201d &amp; \u201coutsource or not outsource?\u201d, fully belongs to you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"When there is a need to introduce new technologies into the company, it means that you should hire the IT","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1901,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1900"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1900"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1900\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1902,"href":"https:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1900\/revisions\/1902"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1901"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1900"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1900"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1900"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1367,"date":"2018-01-19T11:39:03","date_gmt":"2018-01-19T11:39:03","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/?p=1367"},"modified":"2018-05-29T21:40:43","modified_gmt":"2018-05-29T21:40:43","slug":"how-big-data-influences-our-daily-life","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/how-big-data-influences-our-daily-life\/","title":{"rendered":"How Big Data Influences Our Daily Life"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/iot-universite-piratage-min.jpg\" rel=\"group\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1368 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/iot-universite-piratage-min.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/iot-universite-piratage-min.jpg 800w, https:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/iot-universite-piratage-min-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/iot-universite-piratage-min-768x480.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The modern society is surrounded by technological trends, which change each other rapidly. One of those trends is the development of the Big Data. What is that? Who produces and analyzes the Big Data? How is it applied to a life of random people? We will find the answer to all those and even more questions in this article. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the world of applied science &#8211; Big Data is the complex of technologies that are aimed at performing three kinds of operations. First, process big amount of data, in comparison to a \u201cstandard\u201d one. Second, be able to proceed, analyze and apply information that flows very fast. Third, should be able to work with both structured and unstructured data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defining the place, where Big Data is applied &#8211; we can think about Hadron Collider that collects a huge amount of material using sensors. After that, scientists analyze collected data and work on the resolution of global problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some may claim that this technology is not applicable to a life of simple people, but it is closer than you can imagine. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Social networks<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every person is generating dozens of Mbs of data every minute. We are using social networks, search systems, discount systems in the shops, text messaging and many other features, that provide information to the \u201cBig Computer\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, instead of sorting the news by the date of posting, Facebook shows the most popular ones. In the same way, analyzing your activity, you receive suggestions on posts which may be interesting to you or friends you may know. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is just one of the examples of the way Big Data influences our daily life.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Internet of Things<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One more example is the Internet of Things. This topic was described in details in <a href=\"http:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/what-is-the-internet-of-things-and-how-it-is-already-transforming-our-lives\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one of the previous articles<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and that is also a part of the Big Data revolution. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now the development of it is in the early stages, but scientists predict that we will use features of the \u201csmart life\u201d on daily basis. Your Smart Home will warm up or cool down before you come back from work. Smart Fridge will analyze amount of stuff left and order a bottle of beer for you every Friday, and every Saturday police will follow your car and check percentage of the alcohol in your blood. The self-driving car will wait for you after the work and drive you through your favorite shops, meanwhile, you will be getting advertising regarding discounts in those shops.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time should pass before it happens, while today Big Data is used in the entertainment and marketing. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Future Forecasting<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Big Data also could be used for predicting results of the sports competitions, like Olympic Games. In 2012, scientists performed simulation of the Olympic Games, and stated that the US would get 108 medals, in fact, 104 medals were received by the USA during non-simulated competition. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As already mentioned, Big Data analyses a huge amount of information coming from different sources. In practice, this technology may prevent epidemic of illness in one or other regions, taking into account Google searches and confidential information recorded in hospitals. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>GPS Navigation and prevention of Traffic jams<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The system of \u201cSmart traffic\u201d is used in the big cities, like London. Sensors in the traffic lights evaluate traffic tension and change the light color according to the need. In this way, traffic jams are reduced and citizens feel more comfortable traveling to\/from work during rush hours. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the same way, when you use the GPS navigation, you are forwarded to the streets where traffic tension is lower.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Bank-issued credits and insurance services<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever visited a bank in order to take a loan or apply for credit card? If yes &#8211; you probably know that it takes some time, while a bank assistants are checking your personality, credibility and financial situation. That is one more example of the Big Data applications in practice. Banks have access to information which helps to secure money and give loans only to trusted people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same solution is used by insurance providers, as insurance rate is different for every individual. For instance, buying an insurance for a car, the insuring company analyzes your driving experience, incidents, amount of fines, etc. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Big Data provides a lot of advantages to different kinds of companies, at the same time decreasing frauds.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Summing up<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Big Data is a strong analyzing system that is slowly coming to all aspects of our daily life. People do not even realize how much information the \u201cBig Computer\u201d knows about every single person. Nowadays, only 5% of information is available for analyzing, but this number is increasing rapidly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does not matter if we want it or not &#8211; the Big Data is coming into our lives. Today, only 5% of the available information can be analyzed by Big Data, so the most interesting is awaiting us in future.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"The modern society is surrounded by technological trends, which change each other rapidly.

In the early beginning, the VR and AR gadgets have been treated as gaming tools which would probably become wanted among children. Nowadays, companies present a wide range of software and hardware supporting Virtual and Alternative Reality. We have touched upon this topic in the <a href=\"http:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/trends-of-the-it-industry-that-will-develop-in-2018\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">previous article<\/a>. In the following piece of writing, we will analyze trends of the VR and AR more specifically.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #5ac8ff;\">Dynamic Storytelling<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Journalists rule the scene, especially when it comes to the presentation of the new trends. American magazines <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The New York Times<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/interactives.ap.org\/2015\/suite-life\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Suite Life<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/international\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Guardian<\/a> presented a new way of storytelling and article writing. They have presented the software, with which you may feel the news from the inside. For example, instead of reading about the camp of escapees from Syria, now you can feel as you are in there.<\/p>\n<p>The Suite Life grants you with a possibility to see the luxury apartments, cruise ships, private planes and the best hotels from the inside. Rather than watching photos &#8211; you could have a virtual tour of the place that you could never visit.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #5ac8ff;\">Virtual Education<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Do you remember history, geography or any other lessons from the school times? Was it easy for you to understand the way how people lived in the 10th century only watching pictures? How did you feel realizing how big is the Atlantic Ocean or Sahara desert? Was not easy to do, right?<\/p>\n<p>Nowadays, technologies make the studying process easier and faster. Just imagine, you are a twelve-year-old pupil sitting in the classroom, and the subject of the lesson is Egypt. You are not supposed to read lots of articles, the only thing you need to do &#8211; is to wear an Optical Head-mounted display and start the adventure. You may see the process of building pyramids, Egyptian kings, and dynasties. Now you can follow all stages of the country development. Sounds fantastic, right?<\/p>\n<p>This is the way the education and tourism will be developing in the next few years. If you want to travel all over the world, but don&#8217;t have enough money, you can benefit from Virtual Reality. Just imagine that you are walking around Paris, have fun during Carnaval in Brazil, attend wedding in the African tribble or walk inside pyramids without leaving your apartments. Time will show us if this is the new branch of tourism development or death for tourism business.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #5ac8ff;\">Virtual Reality in Medicine<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, VR may be used not just for fun, but also in the learning processes. Using the Virtual Reality gadgets, young doctors may train the skills up to excellence, before they make injections or surgery to real patients. This system guarantees enough training experience, ability to practice on situations that rarely happen in the real life.<\/p>\n<p>Also, the Optical Head-mounted display can be used in the treatment of vision illnesses. James Blaha, founder of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seevividly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vivid Vision<\/a>, together with his team found the way of medication the strabismus (a visual problem in which the eyes are not aligned properly and point in different directions) and vision disabilities with special software adjusted to Virtual Reality hardware. Development of this feature will help people with eyesight impairments without high-cost surgery.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #5ac8ff;\">Training for Pilots and Tankmen in the VR, Improved Simulator from 1920`s or New Feature in Learning<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>First flight simulator for training pilots was created in the early 1920`s. With the development of the Virtual Reality, training platforms for pilots, tankmen, and soldiers in general, become more realistic and convenient.<\/p>\n<p>With the new tools, it is possible to simulate situations which are impossible to perform during real training or that would cost a lot of money. For example, crash of the plane above the ocean, desert or mountains, turning the tank upside down, etc. This technology gives users a real feeling of the situation and reduces stress when this occurs in reality.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #5ac8ff;\">Virtual Reality Applied in Fitness, a Virtual or Real Fitness?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blackbox-vr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Black Box VR<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.runtastic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Runtastic<\/a>\u00a0presented the new generation of personal fitness training. With this application, you will fill the difference between boring fitness training in gym and exciting video game, where you will perform special assignments as a main hero of the movie. For instance, you have to save a city from zombie apocalypse or robots attack, and all exercises performed in physical reality will make sense in the virtual one. Exercises are generated according to your physical condition, lifestyle and preferences, which will make exercising the way funnier and easier.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #5ac8ff;\">New Reality of Video Gaming<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Of course, we cannot forget about Video Gaming, as it becomes even more realistic. VR is now applied to several kinds of the games like riding and war simulators, and horrors. Instead of just playing in front of the screen, a user is plunged into a game. Video Gaming Virtual Reality works in the same way as in training or learning processes, user experience same feelings as it was real. User may feel sick while playing riding simulator, feel in danger fighting with monsters or feel the shots. This technology definitely distracts users from the real life.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #5ac8ff;\">Augmented Reality<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Augmented Reality, when physical world meets a Virtual one. On the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/9\/12\/16272904\/apple-arkit-demo-iphone-augmented-reality-iphone-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2017 Apple presentation<\/a>, they introduced the AR tool for a smartphone camera. With this software user may place new equipment into the room or place dragon to the party. As well as, Ukrainian software engineer created an <a href=\"http:\/\/patrioty.org.ua\/society\/khity-tyzhnia-do-divchyny-z-kolomyi-pryishlo-vsesvitnie-vyznannia-stvorenyi-ukrainkoiu-mobilnyi-dodatok-kompaniia-apple-vyznala-odnym-iz-naikrashchykh-za-2017-rik-211077.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">application<\/a> which allows you place the tattoo on your body and check if it suits you or not. Also, she plans to develop the app, so users will be able to try accessories, closes and jewelry.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #5ac8ff;\">Long Story Short<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Virtual and Augmented reality is slowly becoming a part of our life, and in few years, most probably, we will not be able to exist without Optical Head-mounted display.

Sometimes it is really hard to follow all the trends, as they change each other rapidly. Few years ago we haven`t been thinking about the existence of cryptocurrency, while today even the lazy people are discussing the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. What will next years of technological development bring to us? Let&#8217;s have a look at the prediction of IT trends that will shake the world in 2018.<\/p>\n<h2>Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Augmented and Virtual Reality<\/h2>\n<p>Artificial intelligence is something that is being discussed everywhere, but it is not implemented by mass businesses yet. We all have heard about Siri, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/zarastone\/2017\/11\/07\/everything-you-need-to-know-about-sophia-the-worlds-first-robot-citizen\/#121f3646fa14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alexa and human-like robot Sofia<\/a>, who shook the world of technologies recently. Not everyone is aware of the fact that artificial intelligence has been existing among us for many years.<\/p>\n<p>One of the branches of artificial intelligence is the development of the face-detection feature that is not used only for smartphone unlocking. Basically, face detection has been used for years until now. Curious how?\u00a0 Have you ever noticed, that Facebook offers you to tag your friends in the photos? Also, this feature is available on every smartphone, when your photos are being sorted by people, locations, and dates. Those are examples of Artificial intelligence and face detection in action.<\/p>\n<p>The face recognition can be implemented into video monitoring of premises, and increasing security of Banks and ATMs. For example, in addition to password identification ATM terminal could recognize a person by face. Also, employers will be able to track how much time employees are spending at the workplaces. In order to do that, an employer will not need to spend hours next to the CCTV, the system would do it by itself and manager will get a report in the end of the certain period of the time.<\/p>\n<p>In the previous years, almost all the companies have been presenting Head-mounted displays. This equipment may show an image generated by computer only, or a mix of the reality and virtual reality. Some people claim that it is the next generation of expensive toys for children, while others say that it will become an important element if daily life.<\/p>\n<p>Experts are sure that during the next years AI, Robotics, AR, and VR will increase cooperation, offering more complementary solutions for businesses. The next year will show the new directions, in the technological development.<\/p>\n<h2>Internet of Things and the development of \u201cHuman Less\u201d solutions<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cSmart home\u201d, \u201csmart building\u201d, \u201csmart office\u201d \u201csmart shops and storages\u201d &#8211; all those \u201csmart\u201d innovations are surrounding us over past few years. This is an outcome of the <a href=\"http:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/industries\/iot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Internet of Things<\/a>\u00a0 development.<\/p>\n<p>The American shop Walmart is involving smart storages and smart shelves, those innovations allow shelves and storages monitor the number of goods which is left, and create orders for things which should be added. Also, they are planning to introduce robots and drones, which will place goods from storages to shelves.<\/p>\n<p>Does that mean that there will be less job for humans? Managers of the shop claim the opposite, they say that new technologies will allow people to be more involved in \u201chuman tasks\u201d, for example in cooperation with customers. Basically, the involvement of Human Less trends will increase the amount of workers in IT sphere and decrease requirements for people to perform physical kinds of work.<\/p>\n<h2>Blockchain development is not limited to Bitcoins<\/h2>\n<p>You surely have heard about the cryptocurrency but if you need more information &#8211; check out <a href=\"http:\/\/inx.wp-funnel.com\/a-blockchain-explanation-your-parents-will-understand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our article<\/a>. The Blockchain technology is not limited to the use in the cryptocurrency development, there are more technologies based on the blockchain, that will be developing during next years.<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain scaling. This innovation is created to accelerate the processes without sacrificing security. Nowadays, in the blockchain \u2013 every computer takes part in the processing of every transaction. In fact, that is not efficient enough. Blockchain scaling figures out how many computers are required to validate each transaction, then operations are being divided. Scaling will add security, efficiency, and productivity to the existing blockchain system.<\/p>\n<p>Smart contract. While a standard contract outlines the terms of a relationship (usually one enforceable by law), a smart contract enforces a relationship using cryptographic protocol. The smart contract follows and assures implementation of the contract conditions. Now the security of the following system is not perfect, but works are ongoing. Most probably, during next few years &#8211; smart contracting will be a powerful system used by thousands of people.<\/p>\n<p>Also, Blockchain can be used in non-financial fields. For example, the EverLeger company uses blockchain in the supply chain, to confirm the source of origin of diamonds. At the same time, start-up Assetcha.in uses blockchain as a system of preservation of valuables. Both, well known and covered possibilities of the Blockchain will develop during next years.<\/p>\n<h2>To sum up<\/h2>\n<p>There was a huge development of technologies over last two decades. The world is concerned the most on the Blockchain, Virtual reality, Artificial developments, Robotics, Smart objects, and many other things that may replace important role of the human. What does it mean for society in reality? Will it make our life easier and more comfortable, or will cause problems for simple people?\u00a0 The answer is in the hands of developers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"We are living in the time of Global changes and mass development of the technologies.

Not so far ago we couldn&#8217;t imagine the fact that every single person would have a mobile phone. Do you remember those moments when you had to explain your parents\/grandparents how to use it? Later on, the Internet came into our daily life, and again the young generation of people had to explain to adults what is that, how to use it and so on.<\/p>\n<p>And in the moment, when everyone feels more or less comfortable with technologies &#8211; the blockchain revolution came into our life. And again, we struggle with the questions from our parents \u201cWhat is blockchain?\u201d, \u201cWho needs it and why bitcoins are so popular?\u201d, \u201cCan you get a couple of bitcoins for me? I would like to buy a new car\u201d, etc. Have you ever heard one of those questions? If \u201cyes\u201d, read this article and find out answers to the most common questions regarding Blockchain.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Blockchain and how is it related to Bitcoins?<\/h2>\n<p>In his article, Jamie Skella compared blockchain to a shared record book. This book contains information about the creation of new blocks (lines). When a new line item is created &#8211; a new edition of the record book is published. This digital record book is stored in thousands of computers and synchronized as soon as the new block is created. It should be admitted that this record book doesn&#8217;t have a central location from which is shared to thousands of computers. It is updated after each transaction on every computer.<\/p>\n<p>I would compare it to the economic or mathematical game, where everyone knows the rules, amount of the resources and conditions how do get the resource. Let&#8217;s try to understand it on the example of bitcoin &#8211; the cryptocurrency created on the principle of the blockchain. The idea of bitcoins is based on the money operations without intervention from the government. There is no head of the Central Bank of Bitcoins who can take a decision. Bitcoins cannot be copied also no one can take a decision to print more of those, which makes devaluation of cryptocurrency impossible. A maximum amount of Bitcoins is 21 million.<\/p>\n<h2>By whom was it created?<\/h2>\n<p>Satoshi Nakamoto created the software for Bitcoins in 2008. Using terminology of Jamie Skella, he created a record book and said: \u201cNow 1 million of bitcoins exists, buy it, sell it, go for more\u201d. Also, he (or she, or they &#8211; the real personality of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown) created rules of the \u201cgame\u201d. There were few tries to uncover real personality of Satoshi. Despite the fact that in the blog he claimed to be 37 years old living in Japan, some take those facts as a false data. Satoshi writes in English fluently, as it is his mother tongue, and the Bitcoin software is not customized for Japanese.<\/p>\n<p>In March 2017, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/newsweek-statement-dorian-nakamoto-232092\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Newsweek\u00a0<\/a>posted an article claiming that Dorian Nakamoto (American with Japanese origin), is a founder of Bitcoin &#8211; Satoshi Nakamoto. This fact had no evidence and was declined by Dorian.<\/p>\n<p>In May 2016, an Australian computer scientist and engineer, Craig Wright claimed that he created the Bitcoins. He also provided evidence, with records of the keys from the first transaction. But the fact is that this data could be easily found by any user of the system. Craig Wright didn`t provide any other evidence and gave up on his worlds.<\/p>\n<p>In the end of November 2017, some journalists were talking about Elon Musk, businessmen, founder of the SpaceX, who probably is covered by the nickname \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d. This information was provided by Sahil Gupta, who performed an internship in the SpaceX. His suggestion was based on the several facts: the C++ language, which is actively used in SpaceX and by Elon Musk, was used for Bitcoin software; also Elon Musk always had a willingness to resolve global problems, Bitcoin was created in 2008 when the world financial crises started. Elon Musk refused those facts saying that the year of 2008 was the most unsuccessful for him, he would not have time and possibilities for creation of such a great software.<\/p>\n<h2>So how can I get the Bitcoins?<\/h2>\n<p>There are few different ways of getting Bitcoin: you can buy it from other users, sell some goods for Bitcoin, buy it on the Bitcoin market or start mining the Bitcoins. The process is very similar to oil production &#8211; the more oil is being in use &#8211; the less is left and the conditions of production are tauter.<\/p>\n<p>Sounds weird, right? Of course, bitcoins are not oil, gold or coal BUT principle created by Satoshi Nakamoto is very similar to the one working on the oil production. We have bitcoins instead of oil and computer instead of a person. In order to get bitcoins &#8211; the person needs to open a new block.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, we have the computer which is working on creating a special, let us say password (hash), which will fulfill all conditions and create a new block (new line in the record book). The condition for opening every new block is more complicated than for previous one. Once the block is opened, miner gets the reward &#8211; the certain amount of bitcoins. And it may last until the time when all bitcoins are founded.<\/p>\n<h2>Does it mean that I can \u201cmine\u201d Bitcoins from my laptop?<\/h2>\n<p>Only if you find a time machine. In 2009 it was more than enough to use a simple laptop for mining of Bitcoins. With time process becomes more and more complicated. Since 2013 mining without special equipment became not cost effective. The cost of electricity which is used during mining is higher than an average income.<\/p>\n<p>Also, there are some gossips about the Bitcoin Farms, where computers with huge capability are earning millions of Dollars for owners of the Farm. In order to create something like that, there is a need to invest around $9 000 000 in the equipment, to get around $1 000 000 of monthly income.<\/p>\n<h2>How much can be earned by mining?<\/h2>\n<p>The amount of Bitcoins which could be earned by mining is divided by 2, every 4 years. In 2009 you would get 50 BTC, after second decreasing, in July 2016, the remuneration for mining is 12.5 BTC. By 2031 it is should be less than 1 Bitcoin, it will last until the time when all 21 million of BTC is mined.<\/p>\n<h2>Does government have any kind of control on the cryptocurrency?<\/h2>\n<p>Status of the bitcoin is different around the globe. It is being classified as a cryptocurrency, money surrogate, non-material goods, virtual product, etc. In Japan, Bitcoin is a legal payment method. In China, Bitcoin is a virtual product, not currency, which means that only individuals, not banks, can perform transactions.<\/p>\n<p>In Australia, Bitcoin is treated as a property and any transaction as a barter. The first Bitcoin bank was created in Austria in February 2017. There is special ATM where you can exchange cryptocurrency to Euro, and in another way around &#8211; exchange Euro to Bitcoin. Similar ATMs exist also in some Asian countries and Ukraine, despite the fact that status of the Bitcoin in Ukraine is not defined yet.<\/p>\n<h2>Summarizing the above<\/h2>\n<p>The Blockchain is a record book, where each transaction is documented in the new line(block). Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, each transaction with which is recorded in the Blockchain. To map a transaction &#8211; new block should be opened by miners. When a new block is opened &#8211; miners get a reward &#8211; certain amount of bitcoins. The system is quite simple in understanding. The only question remains open &#8211; how will it develop in future. Will it be a big step to the new future or system will just crush and something new will be introduced? What we can know for sure, is that future will surprise us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"The world of technologies is changing very rapidly.

One of the factors that contribute to the CMS popularity is that it can be set up in the world network with basic programming knowledge.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a Content Management System?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>CMS In A Nutshell<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A Content Management System is an application that helps to customize, manage, and create information. There are CMSs that can be used alone and some that are usually applied in a conjunction with the others. You can request a CMS that would work on your network, on the Internet, or run locally on your personal computer. The CMS is a key to the quick buildup of a powerful website that would help with maintenance and customization.<\/p>\n<p>Keeping that in mind, you should figure out what you need. The following questions might help you: What exactly do you need? Something like a blog or an online shop? What do you want in your CMS?
